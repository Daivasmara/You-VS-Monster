# You-VS-Monster
My first *mini* game ever created with only Vue.js! I'm using CDN version of Vue due to the simplicity of this project, i was just messing around with directives and properties of Vue, so it may not be perfect but it's awesome for me! It's all started as a challenge from the one and only [Max](https://twitter.com/maxedapps?lang=en) from Academind, but it's **100% my version** of doing it. Feel free to clone and learn!
